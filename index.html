        <h2>What is Worse than Dark Souls?</h2>
        <p>Worse than Dark Souls is a game that is harder than the very popular game series Dark Souls 
        although the game Worse than Dark Souls is nothing like Dark Souls. The only reason that it is 
        called Worse than Dark Souls is because it is much harder than Dark Souls depending on the 
        difficulty that you are playing on. Instead of being a really hard western style rpg, it's a shooter 
        where you have to shoot boxes that can get really difficult.</p>
        <p>Currently there are quite a few glitches like boxes will spawn up against the wall where you can't 
        hit the boxes but I will hopefully fix these issues in the near future.</p>
